# thinkprogramming
This repository stores the code I wrote to learn basic Python commands and logic through the online book [How to think like a computer scientist."](http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/index.html)

Files are by chapter in the book, there are a few dependencies for exercises involved in loading and writing files.
